# remindme.sh

_There are many reminder scripts out there, but this is mine._

This is a quick little script I wrote to remind me of things. The current version is macOS-specific in that it uses `say` and `osascript` to both speak the reminder as well as display it in the Notification Area. 

I included an empty section for Linux for when I am sitting in front of my Linux box and want the same functionality; certainly it's a little bit trickier insofar as the myriad of notification systems available. 

Hope this is useful for you. If you do make it work under Linux, PRs are always welcome!
